General Course Description
The primary intent of this course is to get all of us (students, faculty) to think about ourselves as creative individuals, and to investigate our relationship with digital technology, specifically coding and making. How do we become authors using computation and devices? The course will combine informational lectures that will touch upon a variety of topics with hands-on labs that will require the students to code and build projects related to specific technologies (Javascript, Arduino, openFrameworks, and others). 

Lectures will vary between historical overview, scientific explanation, and philosophy. Although carrying on class discussion in such a big group can be a challenge, we will give it a shot. Hopefully ideas raised in this class will find their way to the studio, and vice-versa. Labs will be hands on. Each lab session will involve building code or devices to accomplish a specific goal. Students will be expected to carry out each lab module, and to apply them to projects. Three projects will be required in the lab during the semester (along with weekly homework), with a fourth project possible at the end of the semester.

This course will have two basic components: the weekly lecture and the weekly lab. The lecture will last one hour 20 minutes per week, and the lab will be a full two hours 40 minutes. The course is broken down as follows:

1. Lecture (in 66 West 12th-- 407, full group). In most cases, lecture topics will parallel topics and work occurring in the lab. The intent is to provide historical, cultural, and other context for the technical subjects taught in the lab. There will not always be a perfect connection between the lecture/lab, but we’ll do our best.

2. Lab (6 E 16th St. -- room 903). This year the lab will focus on programming with Javascript, Physical Computing with Arduino, and a brief introduction to the C++ programming language using openFrameworks. We will spend about a third of the time on each topic. There will be a final project in each topic. At the end of the semester, there will be an elective lab project (meaning non-required). We will also be introducing you to one or more micro computer platforms for use in your work (either Raspberry Pi or Intel Galileo, TBD).

Assignments
There are three project deliverables for this course, one for each of the (below listed) topics. It is considered desirable to combine projects undertaken in CC with your Major Studio projects. You will have the opportunity to execute a fourth, optional project at the end of the semester. In addition to projects, you will be expected to continue to improve technically (and to demonstrate it in your project solutions), via a variety of weekly homework assignments throughout the semester. You should spend appropriate time designing, developing, and executing each homework assignment and/or project. The course is divided loosely into three parts. The following description provides general details of each part, and the learning outcomes that the related project should demonstrate. Specific details of each course section will be provided in class.

Weekly Homework: 
Due emailed to me at bockq716@newschool.edu each Tuesday 12 am
A concept statement (read: one sentence) describing a possible application that you would be interested in pursuing for the technology we covered most recently.

Assessable Tasks and Learning Outcomes
By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
 
Demonstrate an understanding of the iterative making process as relates to code or physical computing, using incremental methods such as prototyping and testing to build toward more advanced work 
Demonstrate an understanding of the basic technologies presented in the CC Lab (web scripting, electronics and physical computing, compiled programming), including which projects might be appropriate to apply specific technologies too
Demonstrate effective application of course technologies to projects within the MFADT Major Studio environment
Understand why the technologies presented are relevant to the current (and future) worlds of art and design, as well as our broader society
Understand and execute “writing” of code, as compared to cut-and-paste borrowing or “reading” of code.
Be able to archive and document technical work in a demonstrative and reflective manner for presentation and referencing
Demonstrate an ability to recognize the importance of innovation, creative thinking, risk-taking, and experimentation

Grading Standards

A  [4.0; 96–100%]
Work of exceptional quality, which often goes beyond the stated goals of the course

A- [3.7; 91 –95%]
Work of very high quality

B+ [3.3; 86–90%]
Work of high quality that indicates substantially higher than average abilities

B  [3.0; 81–85%]
Very good work that satisfies the goals of the course

B- [2.7; 76–80%]
Good work

C+ [2.3; 71–75%]
Above-average work

C  [2.0; 66–70%]
Average work that indicates an understanding of the course material; passable
Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of C or higher.

C- [1.7; 61–65%]
Passing work but below good academic standing

F  [0.0; 0–45%]
Failure, no credit

Grade of W
The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete.

Grade of WF
The grade of WF is issued by an instructor to a student (all undergraduates and all graduate students) who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade. The WF is equivalent to an F in calculating the grade point average (zero grade points), and no credit is awarded.

Grades of Incomplete
The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with input from Parsons Office of Advising: 

Divisional, Program and Class Policies 
● Responsibility
Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.  Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. 
 
● Participation
Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time. 
 
● Attendance
Faculty members may fail any student who is absent for a significant portion of class time. A significant portion of class time is defined as three absences for classes that meet once per week and four absences for classes that meet two or more times per week. During intensive summer sessions a significant portion of class time is defined as two absences. Lateness or early departure from class may also translate into one full absence.
 
● Blackboard or Canvas
Use of Blackboard may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week. 
 
● Delays
In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class.  If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival.  In the event that I will miss class entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.
 
● Academic Integrity
This is the university’s Statement on Academic Integrity: “Plagiarism and cheating of any kind in the course of academic work will not be tolerated.  Academic honesty includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of instructors and other students).  These standards of academic honesty and citation of sources apply to all forms of academic work (examinations, essays, theses, computer work, art and design work, oral presentations, and other projects).”
 
It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others.  Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.
